### 🧩 Architecture Approach

The project follows a **component-based architecture**.

Each section of the landing page was developed as an independent component inside a `/components` folder and dynamically loaded into `index.html` using JavaScript.

#### Project structure:

/components  
├─ header.html  
├─ main.html  
├─ testimonials.html  
├─ gallery.html  
└─ footer.html

This approach allowed:

- Modular and scalable development
- Easier team collaboration
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Cleaner and more maintainable code
- Framework-like structure without using a framework
